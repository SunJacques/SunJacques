## ðŸŒŸ Projects:


- **[Recommendation System](https://github.com/SunJacques/Recommendation-System)** (September 2024 - October 2024)
  - IMDB movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization on a user-movie rating dataset
  - Implementation of gradient descent variants and similarity-based methods, enhanced with custom rounding for rating predictions

- **[SinGAN](https://github.com/SunJacques/SinGAN)** (May 2024 - June 2024)
  - Worked under the supervision of Arthur Leclair (MVA teacher) on the SinGAN paper for 4 weeks.
  - Implemented a simpler version of SinGAN.

- **[Medical Classification](https://github.com/SunJacques/Medical_classification)** (April 2024)
  - Developed a dermoscopic images classifier for 8 different diagnostic classes.
  - Trained a UNet for segmentation.
    
- **[Disaster Scenes Semantic Segmentation](https://github.com/SunJacques/LPCVC-2023)** (June 2023)
  - Trained deep learning models with PyTorch segmenting disaster scenes captured by drone
  - Optimized the model making it suitable for deployment on low-power edge devices on 2GB of RAM
