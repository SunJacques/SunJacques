## ðŸŒŸ Projects:

- **[SinGAN](https://github.com/SunJacques/SinGAN)** (May 2024 - June 2024)
  - Worked under the supervision of Arthur Leclair (MVA teacher) on the SinGAN paper for 4 weeks.
  - Implemented a simpler version of SinGAN.

- **[Medical Classification](https://github.com/SunJacques/Medical_classification)** (April 2024)
  - Developed a dermoscopic images classifier for 8 different diagnostic classes.
  - Trained a UNet for segmentation.
    
- **[Disaster Scene Segmentation Classification](https://github.com/SunJacques/LPCVC-2023)** (June 2023)
  - Trained deep learning models with PyTorch segmenting disaster scenes captured by drone
  - Optimized the model making it suitable for deployment on low-power edge devices on 2GB of RAM
